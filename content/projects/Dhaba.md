A React Native app that helps people in Austin discover local food trucks. Itâ€™s built with React Native and has an interactive map to make it easy to find new spots nearby. The app uses a secure OAuth system with PassportJS for safe logins and runs on a Node.js and Express REST API backend that handles location-based data for dozens of food trucks and hundreds of requests.
